The senario is like we have made the snake to move and control, now we need to acheive a food creation ,
when the snake touches means it eats the food,means we need to extend the size of the snake ,immediately we need to create
another foodd at random in the screen

when the game ends ?
that also needs to be discussed

1. create food - this is a turtle inherited class
    describe the shape
    size
    colour
    how fast this moves  ?
    and present at random location ? - need to consider the screen size
